## Conclusions

Unit tests significantly improved the development process by:
- Catching edge-case errors early
- Enabling safe refactoring of list operations 

I learned how to create unit tests and also how to use GitHub Actions.

While initial setup required time, the debugging efficiency gained far 
outweighed the effort. Tests became an essential part of the development 
workflow rather than a "waste of time."
